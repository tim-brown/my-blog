Title: Introduction to “Simple Things”

I have called this blog “A simple blog about simple things”. In this
post start by explaining what I mean when I say “simple”. After that, I
will touch on why I consider the topics I will choose to talk about to
be “simple”.

Don’t expect any of this to be inherently easy (although, some of it
_is_). I’ll also use this post to explain why not.

## Think of something _Simple_

Before you read on and find out what my idea of simple is, I would like
you to (as the title of the section suggests): think od something
simple. It could be an object, activity, idea, or even an algorithm. You
just need to be able to say “Yeah, that’s simple” about it.

Good. Now you have your subject in mind --- why do you think it is
simple?

* Is its name simple (run the name through the checks below)?
* Is it made up of many or few parts?
* Can you understand it without “nuance” or surprise?
* Can you do it easily (for an action) or is it easy to use (if it’s
  applicable)?

Give it a good chew over.

## Think of Simplicity

We’ll keep those questions in mind; and 


It could be that these things are indicators of simplicity, but each of
these questions identifies a different attribute of your subject:

* Is it *easy*? I will touch on _ease_ later --- because the
  relationship between simplicity and ease is, well, uneasy.
* Is it *atomic*? I suppose that atomic things are simple... an atom has
  properties that can be understood without nuance or surprise (in
  isolation). But anything else --- molecular or compound --- will have
  material properties that you need to decide whether they are simple or
  not. Since this is not a chemistry blog, I won’t be considering true
  atoms

  (Also, consider [carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon)).
  I genuinely don’t know if it is simple... it allows
